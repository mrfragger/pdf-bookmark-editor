 There should be a free PDF editor for bookmarks without ads or a subscription.  I looked but never could find one.  Just a few python command line ones that work great for advanced users. This is all local.  No cdn (content delivery networks) either just 3 files loaded ~3MB total

Doesn't do vertical position within PDFs (pretty much requires python pymupdf) but allows one to easily modify bookmarks for pages.  Add bookmarks (chapter, section or subsection) by selecting text within PDF and using shortcut keys.
