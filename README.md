Add / Edit bookmarks for a PDF, Titlelize, merge PDFS retaining existing bookmarks.  Should be a free PDF editor for bookmarks without ads or a subscription.  I looked but never could find one.  Just a few python command line ones that work great for advanced users.

Doesn't do vertical position within PDFs but allows one to easily modify bookmarks.  Add bookmarks (chapter, section or subsection) by selecting text within PDF and using shortcut keys.
